# Welcome to Torch on AMP!
These files allows you to run TorchAPI on the CubeCoders AMP Panel.
## You can:
- Edit torch configs
- Add / remove people on whitelist
- Add / remove / configure plugins through File Manager
- Create a fully functioning torch server from start.
## Limitations
- Plugin listing is not available. You will need to manually install plugins and add them in via file manager
- Editing plugin config is not supported.
- You cannot send messages in console, you can only read them. This will be eventually fixed by having a compainion plugin.

<hr>
Please note that these limitations are here mainly due to how AMP works and me being relatively new to making configs.<br>
This project is still experimental! It may not work for some users. The application was tested using Windows Server 2022. Currently Linux on Torch is in a very *very* buggy state, so Linux support is currently not supported.<br>
Feel free to contribute to the github anytime!<br>
