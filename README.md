# Welcome to Torch on AMP!
These files allows you to run Space Engineers TorchAPI on the CubeCoders AMP Panel.<br>
https://cubecoders.com/AMP
## This is a spinoff of Greelan's Torch Template just with a few QOL changes.
Keep in mind one of the changes is removing linux support, as it runs very slowly.

## You can:
- Send and recieve messages, and console commands
- Edit torch configs
- Add / remove people on whitelist
- Add / remove / configure plugins through File Manager
- Create a fully functioning torch server from start.
## Limitations
- **For a seamless out of box experience, Torch on AMP will only work on Windows server 2019/2022/2025 operating systems. Please note that Torch on AMP for Home/Pro instances are not supported, however more information can be found [here](https://github.com/sam4413/amp-spaceengineers/blob/main/RegularWindows.md).**
## Installation
Please note SE Torch on AMP works only on Windows Server 2019/2022/2025. Home/Pro instances can work, but are not supported due to the extra manual steps needed.<br>
Installing SE Torch on AMP is very easy! Just follow these 3 simple steps:
### Step 1:
In AMP, go to `Configuration` -> `Instance Deployment` and `Add a Configuration Repository`
### Step 2:
Add a configuration repository, and put in `sam4413/amp-spaceengineers`
### Step 3:
Press `Fetch latest` then go into your instances and create an instance. You should see Space Engineers Torch on there.

<hr>
Please note that these limitations are here mainly due to how AMP works and me being relatively new to making configs.<br>
This project is still experimental! It may not work for some users. The application was tested using Windows Server 2022. Currently Linux on Torch is in a very *very* buggy state, so Linux support is currently not supported.<br>
Feel free to contribute to the github anytime!<br>
